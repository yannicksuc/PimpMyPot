## ✨ What is PimpMyPot?

Minecraft lets you decorate pots, but it can be **a bit clunky**—you often need to recraft the whole pot to change a design.  

**PimpMyPot** makes decorating **easier, faster, and more fun**!  
💡 Simply apply sherds to your pot **without recrafting**, and update any side individually.  

- In **Survival**, old sherds are returned automatically.  
- In **Creative**, decorate freely with unlimited sherds.  

Make your world **more colorful and personal** in just a few clicks! 🎉

## 🎁 Features

- 🎨 Apply sherds to **front, back, left, or right** sides of pots **without recrafting**.  
- 🛡 **Survival-safe:** consumes sherds, refunds replaced ones, drops extras if inventory is full.  
- 🚀 **Creative-friendly:** unlimited decorating for endless fun.  
- 💬 **Subtle action bar notifications** keep you in the flow.
